If you show interest to your children, they feel important; they feel supported, and consequently, they feel motivated. That is why I believe love is the most relevant part of teaching, just as Pestalozzi did throughout his life. Pestalozzi believed that education should develop the powers of the head, heart, and hands. He trusted that this would help create individuals capable of knowing what is right and what is not and acting according to this knowledge. I always try my students to learn how to use their heads through their thinking, their head through their interests and motivations, and their hands through not just thinking but doing something.</p>

      <p class="lead mb-0"> I think my teaching way to reach three main points: knowing, thinking, and feeling. In this part, I do not focus on the results (doing) but on all the processes before. Students must be able to know, think and feel during their proceeding, doing a balance between them. My students learn how to know: they know they differ between trustable and untrustable resources. They become able to identify what kind of information they must ignore (unless they want to go deeper into the topic, and false news or false information can help get it). They must learn how to think: my students learn to differentiate between personal thinking and a great idea. Also, they must know how to work through design thinking.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-0">During design thinking, a modern method to innovate ideas to solve real needs, the student goes through six phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. In the first part, empathize, the student needs to try to understand the context, they put themselves in the other's position, so they can amplify their vision about the needs. In the second step, define, they must make decisions about what they want to do. In the third phase, ideate, they share their individual ideas to select the most appropriate ones and modify the other ones, taking into account every single idea. During the “prototype”, they have to show the ideas in simple ways, and in the last part, the test, they can do different things just as role-play to simulate the execution.</p>

            Memory is far from the most relevant part of education in this digital era. If it is about vocabulary, anyone can easily use a virtual translator. They do not need more than one minute. This digital area requires people who know what to do with all that vocabulary. Computers can translate, but computers cannot learn how to create. Computers cannot make art. Machines can investigate but they are not able to research. That is my mission. I want my students not to be easily replaced by software.
Also, I do not want a person remembering to me as the English teacher who taught them what a transitive verb is. I want to be more human for them. I want them to remind me as the teacher who understood their needs. The one who did not judge but supported them. I do not want to cut their wings but help them to fly. If they feel like they can trust me not only for my knowledge of English but also for guidance in different situations, I will be 50% satisfied. The other 50% is if they reach the 4 C's.
It is possible to summarize the 21-century skills into 4 C's: communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. If my students can reach them, they are ready to front the 21 century needs. In the first one, communication, they must be able to transfer what they want to express in the best way. For the second one, they have to let aside their ego and understand they live in society. Most of the time, people need other people to accomplish great goals. In critical thinking, they must be able to infer ideas and produce arguments. For last, they have to be creative. They have to innovate and use their crazy ideas. Maybe one of those is the next century revolution.

            In ten years, due to my two majors, education in English and Spanish and medicine, I see myself as a researcher who uses neuroscience and pedagogy. I believe I can find something substantial about the learning process to create new functional theories for teachers. All this through emphasizing the advantages or disadvantages that the limbic system and brain plasticity can bring to the classroom as a virtual space.          </div>
